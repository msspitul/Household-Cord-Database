# Household-Cord-Database
Manually collected info about the hundreds of cords/cables in my home, then used it to build a database from scratch. Steps included relational/conceptual/logical modeling, DDL/DML SQL tasks, implementing advanced queries to draw insight from the data, and connecting the database to a front-end interface for further reporting capabilities.
